## Curriculum 
Our school curriculum has been developed to ensure that our students emerge from Mount Hutt College as confident, connected, life-long learners. We have placed an emphasis on making connections between subjects and in years 7 and 8 we have developed a connected curriculum programme in English, social studies, ICT and second language learning.
